        'An object remains at rest or in motion unless acted upon by a force',
        'Force equals mass times acceleration',
        'Every action has an equal and opposite reaction',

      correctAnswer: 'An object remains at rest or in motion unless acted upon by a force',
      explanation: 'Newton\'s First Law, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.',
